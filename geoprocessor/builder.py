def _get_segment_intersection(segment1, segment2):
    """
    Calculates the intersection point of two line segments, if it exists
    and lies on both segments.

    This function uses vector parametric equations. A line segment is represented as a
    starting point plus a fraction of a direction vector. It solves for the values
    ('t' and 'u') that would make the two lines meet, and then checks if those values
    are between 0 and 1, which confirms the intersection lies on both segments.

    TODO: has issues with overlapping segments, see tests

    Args:
        segment1 (tuple): A tuple (P1, P2) where P1 and P2 are Point objects.
        segment2 (tuple): A tuple (P3, P4) where P3 and P4 are Point objects.

    Returns:
        Point or None: The intersection Point object if the segments intersect,
                       otherwise None. Returns None for collinear segments as per
                       the problem's context (endpoints and graph building handle these).

        Calculates the signed area of the parallelogram formed by two 2D vectors.

        See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Geometric_meaning

        This is commonly known as the "2D cross product". It is derived by
        treating the 2D vectors v1=(x1, y1) and v2=(x2, y2) as 3D vectors
        v1'=(x1, y1, 0) and v2'=(x2, y2, 0) and then calculating the Z-component
        of their 3D cross product (v1' Ã— v2').

        The resulting scalar value is extremely useful for determining the relative
        orientation of the two vectors.

        - The sign of the result indicates orientation:
          - > 0: The turn from v1 to v2 is counter-clockwise (v2 is "left" of v1).
          - < 0: The turn from v1 to v2 is clockwise (v2 is "right" of v1).
          - = 0: The vectors are collinear (lie on the same line).

        - The absolute value of the result is the area of the parallelogram
          spanned by the two vectors.

        Args:
            v1 (Point): The first 2D vector, represented as a Point object.
            v2 (Point): The second 2D vector, represented as a Point object.

        Returns:
            float: The scalar value (z-component) of the 3D cross product,
